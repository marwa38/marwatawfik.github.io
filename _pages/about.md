Tawfik was a Moore Foundation-funded University of Aberdeen Visiting Scholar at [Dorrestein Lab, University of California, San Diego](https://dorresteinlab.ucsd.edu/) working in collaboration with [Bolnick Lab, University of Connecticut](https://today.uconn.edu/experts/expert-profile/daniel.bolnickphd/daniel-bolnick-phd/) on several big -omics datasets to answer different immunological adaptation questions using approaches that include mainly RNAseq, 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.  

Tawfik was previously a Newton-funded PhD Scholar at University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK in the Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre, College of Life Sciences and Medicine where she worked under supervision of [Prof Sam Martin](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/sam.martin/) (leading supervisor) and [Prof Alex Douglas](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/a.douglas/) (co-supervisor). During her PhD studies, research main focus was on -omics technology to tackle sustainbaility issues in aquaculture with questions of how we can increase acceptance and utlisation of plant-based diets in Atlantic salmon by applying nutritional programming strategy druing first feeding as part of [NUTRIPROG](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FR018812%2F1), a BBSRC funded project between [Scottish Fish Immunology Research Centre](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/research/sfirc.php) and [Institute of Aquaculture](https://www.stir.ac.uk/about/faculties/natural-sciences/aquaculture/), University of Stirling with BioMar as their industrial partner. Tawfik investigated the underlying adaptive mechanisms of nutritional programming by robust analysing the gut microbiome and transcriptome using Atlantic salmon as the animal model. Besides, she worked as a demonstrator on a number of courses ranging from biostatistics and bioinformatics to biodiversity courses.

Tawfik earned her Masters and Bachelor degree in Veterinary Medical Sciences from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo and Zagazig University, Egypt respectively. During her masters reseach work, she worked on synthesising different nanomaterials as feed additives while obtaining a Postgraduate Diploma in Material Science and Nanotechnology from Beni-Suef University, Egypt.

Tawfik secured several other grants for early career researchers including NoWPaS grant, Turing Scheme Fund, Santander Mobility Award, SAIC travel award, and Charles Sutherland Scholarship fund among others that enabled her to visit labs and presented her work in conferences and meetings. Tawfik achieved the second-best poster (overall) presented at the 20th (Zebra)Fish Immunology/Vaccination Workshop hosted by the Aquaculture & Fisheries group at Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands and was a semifinal for oral presentations at ICISB 2024, Seattle, WA, USA.
